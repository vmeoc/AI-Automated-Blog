First, you need to read the .env file.

#Read a google spreadsheet to know which article you need to create
You are connected to the Google spreadhseet used to pilot the blog content. This connection is done through the zapier MCP (Model context protocol) where the tool name Lookup Spreadsheet Row allow you to find the row needed in the file. Use the information .env in this workspace to have all the necessary details to connect to this file. Fill all the needed input of the tool, not only the field "instructions". When the user ask you to work on a blog article, you will find the first row found with the status "unpublished" in the Status column, will give the content you found in the Title and Summary column. Based on this Title and summary, you will think of catchy titles for the blog articles. You will offer the 3 best ones you thought of so that the user can choose the on he prefers.
You will store the row number of the file in <BlogTrackingFile> in a JSON format:
{
  "ExcelFile": [
    {
      "RowNumber": "<rowNumber>"
    }
  ]
}

#create a blog article
If the user agree with the title, you will create this exact folder hierarchy:
a folder with the blog title
        a file in a md format with name blogContent.md 
    
Then, you will start creating the blog content. You will work iteratively with the user until he tells you the content is good and you can proceed to the next step. when you create the blog content, does not add the title since it's already in the root directy name.

#Upload images on Internet
For the blog articles and the social network post, you may need to use images provided by the user. Images for the blog article will be in the folder named "blog article", images for the social networks will be in "Social network". To make this picture available for the blog article and social network you need to upload them using the tool/upload.js function. This function will send in Google Cloud storage the URL and will return the public URL for these pictures. This command syntax is node tool/upload.js --file <filePath>. In the blog directory you will create a "<BlogTrackingFile>" file where you will store the picture URL of each uploaded picture with the format:
{
  "images": [
    {
      "name": "techno_impressionism.jpg",
      "url": "https://cdn.example.com/art/techno_impressionism.jpg"
    }
  ]
}


#update the blog content with an image
When requested by the user, modify the blog content to add a picture at the top of the blog post with the following format:
<h1>
  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
    <a href="${url}"
       imageanchor="1"
       style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;">
      <img border="0"
           data-original-height="1024"
           data-original-width="1024"
           height="400"
           src="${url}"
           width="400" />
    </a>
  </div>
  <br />
</h1>
You'll need to use the $url from pictureURL.js. If there are several pictures, ask the user to choose.


#Deploy a blog article in the blogger platform
If the user agreed on the content, you will turn yourself the content in html and you will use the Make MCP to access the blogger tool to deploy the blog article. If the operation succeed, you will return the blog URL to the user as well as copy the URL in <BlogTrackingFile> with the structure
{
  "blog article": [
    {
      "name": "<blog post name>,
      "url": "<blog url>"
    }
  ]
}

#Send a post on LinkedIn with a catchy content, the blog URL and a picture
Create a catchy post content based on the blog article and saved it in JSON format in <BlogTrackingFile>. If the user agree on the content, send it in LinkedIn with the following format:
{
  "instructions": "<the instruction you create>
  "comment": "<catchy post content that you create>",
  "visibility__code": "Anyone", 
  "content__title": "<Title that you create>",
  "content__description": "<content description that you create>",
  "content__submitted_image_url": "<image url from <BlogTrackingFile>>",
  "content__submitted_url": "<Blog post URL from <BlogTrackingFile>>"
}
If the operation is a success, save the LinkedIN post URL in <BlogTrackingFile> with the format
{
  "LinkedIn Post": [
    {
        "LinkedInPostUrl": "<LinkedIn Post url>"
    }
  ]
}


#Send a post on BlueSky with a catchy content and the blog URL
If the file SocialNetwContentmd does not exist, create a catchy post content based on the blog article and saved it in JSON format in <BlogTrackingFile>. If the user agree on the content, send it in Bluesky with the following format:
{
  "PostContent": "<catchy post content that you created>",
  "Link": "<blog post URL>",
  "LinkTitle": "<catchy title that you create>",
  "LinkDescription": "<catchy description that you create>"
}
If the operation is a success, save the LinkedIN post URL in <BlogTrackingFile> with the format
{
  "BlueSky Post": [
    {
        "BlueSkyPostUrl": "<BlueSky Post url>"
    }
  ]
}


#Update the spreadsheet 
If all the actions were done with success, using the tool google_sheets_update_spreadsheet_row
you are going to update the spreadsheet with the information from the .env and the <BlogTrackingFile> 
In the spreadsheet modify the following column:
Column Status= "Published"

Column "BlueSky Link"= {{Bluesky Post[0].BlueSkyPostUrl}}
